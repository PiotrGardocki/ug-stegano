Run zad1.py script. It will encode all images in 'img' dir with messages array
from script. Encoded images will be saved in 'encoded_img' dir. Script outputs
time of execution (each encryption and decryption) as well as size comparison
before and after encryption.

TODO: make prettier output, add more images and texts, save all results here.
